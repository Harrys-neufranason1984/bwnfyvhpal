I just stumbled out of the theater from watching Kimge kereksin and honestly, wow... my brain feels like a disorganized closet. You know the kind where you try to pull out a single sweater, and suddenly you're swimming in a sea of mismatched socks and questionable fashion choices? That's me right now, mentally, after this film.

First off, let’s talk about the plot. Was there even a plot? Part of me wants to say yes, there was. But another part of me is like, was this some cosmic joke? At times it felt like it was guiding me through a turbulent relationship using a GPS with a dead battery. Could have sworn my eye twitched when the main character (what was her name again?) decided to serenely toss all logic out the window about 30 minutes in. She’s basically like, “Reality? What’s that? I’m too busy dealing with this weekly existential crisis.”

> But hey, the cinematography slapped hard. Whoever’s behind that camera knows how to capture awkwardly beautiful scenes of urban chaos. Like that one shot with the river of cracked pavements and forgotten graffiti. So poignant, it should be part of a hipster art exhibit titled Disenchanted Alleyways.” And the music—I can’t even. That soundtrack is definitely going on my ‘moody existential reflection’ playlist. 

Did anyone else notice the random dog that kept popping up throughout the film? Like, who’s dog is this? What even is his purpose? Maybe that's the whole point. We’re all just random dogs in the movie of life, trotting around doing dog things, occasionally barking at plot twists.

Here’s a fun aside, at one point I tried to google an explanation for one of those lofty metaphors and ended up downloading the script instead. Not exactly Oscar material, but it's something I'll scroll through once I'm brave enough to face its cryptic gems again.

```csharp
if (character.Exists() && plot.Solid)
{
    character.ExecuteLife();
}
else
{
    character.MeditateInConfusion();
}
```

This code probably makes as much sense as the subplot with the broken neon sign. If only life came with a manual like that. 

Anyway, is the movie worth a watch? Sure, if you want a not-so-gentle reminder that films can still be a smorgasbord of WTF moments knitted together by vibes and dramatic cityscapes. Just don’t say I didn’t warn you. The theater seats are still warm. Would I watch it again? Perhaps... if only to understand. Or maybe not. Who knows.
